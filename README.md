# Pneumothorax-Segmentation
Semantic Image Segmentation, CNN, Unet, ResNet34, PyTorch, Keras, Plotly

•	Built CNN models in Colab on 12954 pneumothorax X-rays (DICOM format) to achieve semantic image segmentation. Cleaned the dataset, conducted EDA and used Python Plotly for data visualization with CLAHE

•	Used PyTorch and Keras to build the UNet model respectively with Focal Loss and Dice Loss to train the model, embed the ResNet34 model into UNet to further improve the model performance, and finally reached the Dice Score of 0.65 and the IoU value of 0.35 in the test dataset
